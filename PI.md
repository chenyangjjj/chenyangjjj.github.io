Dr. TengfeiGuo is an Assistant Professor at [Shenzhen Bay Labortory](https://www.szbl.ac.cn/) and [Peking University ShenZhen Graduate School](https://www.pkusz.edu.cn/) in the department of Biomedical Engineering. He received His PhD at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/) under the supervision of Prof. Markus Schwaiger and Prof. Timo Grimmer. 

Dr. TengfeiGuo did his postdoctoral fellowship under the supervision of Prof. William Jagust and Dr. Susan Landau and at the [Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute](http://neuroscience.berkeley.edu/), [University of California Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu/index.html). 

Dr. Guo’s research interests focus on how β-amyloid β (Aβ) and tau affect brain structure and function in aging people and patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) using multi-model neuroimaging and ﻿biofluid markers including﻿ plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) assays. His group will investigate the risk factors of Aβ and tau accumulation, and how Aβ and tau result in neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in aging people’s brain. The ultimate goal is to detect this disease as early as possible and provide novel insights towards the early prevention of AD.
