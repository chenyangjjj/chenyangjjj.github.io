### Projects

**The Shenzhen Aging Brain Study (SABS)**
In order to investigate the AD-related pathologies changes and establish effective prevention scheme for elderly adults who have AD pathologies in China’s aging papulation, elderly adults age 55 and older will be recruited to establish Shenzhen Aging Brain Study (SABS) in Shenzhen Bay Laboratory. Participants in SABS will undergo clinical neuropsychological assessments, blood or CSF collection, PET and MRI imaging, and participant in transcranial ultrasound stimulation treatment if have evidence of abnormal AD pathologies. The SABS project aims to: 1) study the risk factors of Aβ and tau aggregation in China’s aging population; 2) validate the spatial temporal patterns of Aβ and tau accumulation identified in ADNI study, and provides reference for the target brain region and appropriate time window for anti-AD treatment.

**The Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)**
The Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is a longitudinal multicenter study designed to develop clinical, imaging, genetic, and biochemical biomarkers for the early detection and tracking of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Since its launch more than a decade ago, the landmark public-private partnership has made major contributions to AD research, enabling the sharing of data between researchers around the world. Three overarching goals of the ADNI study are: 1, To detect AD at the earliest possible stage (pre-dementia) and identify ways to track the disease’s progression with biomarkers. 2, To support advances in AD intervention, prevention, and treatment through the application of new diagnostic methods at the earliest possible stages (when intervention may be most effective). 3, To continually administer ADNI’s innovative data-access policy, which provides all data without embargo to all scientists in the world. HISTORY ADNI began in 2004 under the leadership of Dr. Michael W. Weiner, funded as a private-public partnership with $27 million contributed by 20 companies and two foundations through the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health and $40 million from the National Institute on Aging. The initial five-year study (ADNI-1) was extended by two years in 2009 by a Grand Opportunities grant (ADNI-GO), and in 2011 and 2016 by further competitive renewals of the ADNI-1 grant (ADNI-2, and ADNI-3, respectively).
