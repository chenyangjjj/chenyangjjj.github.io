The TengfeiGuo Lab is interested in how the brain ages, with a specific focus on factors that modify the association between brain lesions and cognitive performance. 
Our research is motivated by the fact that more than 25% of older adults are considered cognitively normal despite the presence of beta-amyloid in their brain, 
a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease. This fact suggests that other factors interact with beta-amyloid to trigger cognitive deficits in Alzheimer’s disease. 
It also suggests that actions can be taken to prevent or postpone disease-related symptoms. 
The main focus of the TengfeiGuo Lab’s research is therefore to examine the factors that protect against, or worsen, 
the development of cognitive deficits in age-related neurodegenerative diseases.
