Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease, accounting for 60-80% of the cause of dementia. Around 5% of elderly adults age 65 and elder are living with AD, which is a big challenge all over the world. Amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are two key hallmarks of AD, and appear 20 years or more before the presence of manifest clinical symptoms. The advances of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and biofluid markers including plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) assays make it possible to measure Aβ and tau deposition in vivo in the very early stage of AD. It has been commonly suggested that early detection of abnormal Alzheimer's pahtologies changes is extremely important for intervention of the disease progression. Our lab will focus on how Aβ and tau affect brain structure and function in aging people and AD patients using multi-model neuroimaging and biofluid markers including plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) assays.

Research interests: early detection, intervention and prevention of AD

Research target: aging people, preclinical AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia due to AD

Research techniques: CSF/Plasma measurements (Aβ42, Aβ40 and p-Tau), Aβ PET, Tau PET, structural MRI and FDG PET imaging.
